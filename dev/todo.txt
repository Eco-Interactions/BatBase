TEAM:
    - Fully remove pdf files when deleted through UI
        - or eventually add another layer where "trash" could be emptied

    - "Christmas Island - artificial landscape" and "Christmas Island - Forest"
        were created by our editors recently. These names are reserved for the auto-
        generated country-habitat combinations. The only difference is capitalization
        and spacing. If they had typed this into the location combo, it should have
        shown as an existing location to select. We need a naming system for locations
        that does not lead editors to naming in this way and a way to ensure they check
        existing locations first. Especially for whole islands or countries. I think this
        has happened with CE a few times now, creating existing entities. Can we work
        with her to find out how she thinks these locations need to be created when
        they exist. Perhaps she can lead us to something in the UI or tutorial that
        we can adjust to prevent this.
        - Perhaps they selected Australia first, and "Christmas Island" has been treated
        as a country, so it is not included in the form dropdown after Australia is
        selected. With our move to treat terriotries as countries, this situation
        could come up somewhat frequently.
        - They included GPS data and then added a note saying "Location is whole island".
        We especially don't want editors adding gps data without it being relevant to
        the location/interaction being created.

        - merge all [name-habType] in table UI

        - phrasing for
            - Current: United States Minor Outlying Islands [includes the Howland-Baker, Johnston, Midway, US Line and Wake island groups]
            - In doc: United States Minor Outlying Islands (Johnston Atoll, Midway, Wake Islands, Navassa Island, etc.)

    Changes:


        Life isn't a bed of roses, nor is it a world of thorns. The world is as you make it realizing that with forward thinking action, you can move through those situations that stop many. - Byron Pulsifer
    Questions:
    Notes:
Feedback:
Next/future rounds:
    todo:
        - send list of broken urls and dois to kelly
        - bibliography, add links
        - add warning when createing a new taxon with an empty parent rank
        - american samoa, guam,
        - fnish data cleanup with those that weren't done programatically
        - click on main map in new form and show countries locations
    Possible:
        - Weekly 'digest' email with info about new members, submitted feedback and
            publications, maybe totals from data entry?
        - optimize data sync downloads. It takes almost as long as full download, depending on how much needs to be updated
            - if new data hasn't been downloaded in a week, redownload all?
    Next:

        - UI:
                - bold habitat type names
        - testing:
    Then:
    Future:
### _____________________ DEV INTERNAL TASKS _______________________________ ###
Sort:
    - Move filter sets into filter folder
    - when clicking reset local data button on menu bar, figure out how to get
        a diff between the old and new stored data to better track down errors/bugs
    - REFACTOR FORM-MEMORY, all submit and ui files  (dry)
    - REFACTOR - from 'top' to 'main' form

    - replace ucfirst and lcfirst with built in 'toUpperCase'
    - add input type, ie number, to form field confgs
    - when attempting to use the database in FF incognito mode, which does not allow idb. Ignoring for now, will add notice to users at some point.
    - Database doesn't work with IE. Notify user.
    - move db-pg util elem builders to js/util/elems
    - Add responsive styling testing
    - REFACTOR - Filter rows to interaction list in row-data-filters instead of during row build
