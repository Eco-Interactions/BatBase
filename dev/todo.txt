        Life isn't a bed of roses, nor is it a world of thorns. The world is as you make it realizing that with forward thinking action, you can move through those situations that stop many. - Byron Pulsifer
    Questions:
    Notes:
Feedback:
Next/future rounds:
    todo:
        - send list of broken urls and dois to kelly
        - bibliography, add links
        - add warning when createing a new taxon with an empty parent rank
        - american samoa, guam,
        - fnish data cleanup with those that weren't done programatically
        - click on main map in new form and show countries locations
    Possible:
        - Weekly 'digest' email with info about new members, submitted feedback and
            publications, maybe totals from data entry?
        - optimize data sync downloads. It takes almost as long as full download, depending on how much needs to be updated
            - if new data hasn't been downloaded in a week, redownload all?
    Next:

        - UI:
                - bold habitat type names
        - testing:
    Then:
    Future:
### _____________________ DEV INTERNAL TASKS _______________________________ ###
Sort:
    - Move filter sets into filter folder
    - when clicking reset local data button on menu bar, figure out how to get
        a diff between the old and new stored data to better track down errors/bugs
    - REFACTOR FORM-MEMORY, all submit and ui files  (dry)
    - REFACTOR - from 'top' to 'main' form
    - REFACTOR - map-markers
    - REFACTOR - get tag names for the tags column filter menu from stored data rather than hard coded.
    - replace ucfirst and lcfirst with built in 'toUpperCase'
    - add input type, ie number, to form field confgs
    - when attempting to use the database in FF incognito mode, which does not allow idb. Ignoring for now, will add notice to users at some point.
    - Database doesn't work with IE. Notify user.
    - move db-pg util elem builders to js/util/elems
    - Add responsive styling testing
    - REFACTOR - Filter rows to interaction list in row-data-filters instead of during row build
    - Refactor Source data
        - merge detail and core data on client side
