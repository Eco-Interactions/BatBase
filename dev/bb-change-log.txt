SINCE LAST SERVER UPDATE:
    - FORMS
        - Configuration
            - all form-field configuration centralized
            - Views
                - Fields can be stacked in the same row (eg, doi and website)
                - arbitrary number of fields in row
                    - styled by percentage based on total "fields" in row and field size (eg, year is a "small" field)
                        - empty "spacer" fields easy as well.
        - Entity Forms
            - Generally reordered fields to what seems like a more intuitive flow for
                editors, prioritizing required fields and resizing where appropriate
            - Publication
                - Author|editor
                    - note changed to "Note: This publication type can have either authors OR editors."
                    - opposite type disabled and label hidden after selection
                    - labels now show order: 1st, 2nd, etc.
                    - reordered/resized form-fields
                    - when a blank exists in the author order, the final empty field is removed
                        to show more intuitevly the blank must be filled before continuing
