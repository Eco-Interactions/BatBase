    - added getAll to idb-keyval. don't update until the feature gets merged in! https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval/compare/master...zubair-io:get-all

>Test Users
    - TestUser: testuser123
    - testeditor: testeditor123

STANDARDS:
    - append '_' before imported file that requires the indirect 'method string' chaining
    - alphbetize where sensible
## ======================= REGULAR USE ====================================== ##
php bin/console cache:clear
/var/log/apache2/error.log

## RESET LOCAL DB ##
    - $ ./dev/resetdb.sh

## Generate Assets ##
> Asset generation commands:
    - $ yarn run encore dev
    - $ yarn run encore dev --watch (run while actively working on asset code)
    - $ yarn run encore production (Switch output path in webpack.config.js first)

## Composer Memory Limit ##
    - $ which composer (returns path to composer)
    - $ php -d memory_limit=-1 [path] [command]
        - php -d memory_limit=-1 /usr/local/bin/composer [command]

## ======================= DEPLOYMENT STEPS ================================= ##

>STEPS TO DEPLOY TO SERVER

NOTIFY SENTRY OF NEW RELEASE:
    - run ./sentry_release.sh
    - copy the release name <YYYMMDD_BEI>
GENERATE ASSET FILES WITH WEBPACK:
    - webpack.config.js > Comment DEV specific config and uncomment PROD config
    - paste in the release name
    - yarn run encore production

SERVER UPDATES:
    - set up the 'clone' sub-domain first
        - update env [db_name, release, role_qa]
        - update relevant changed files on server
        - handle any database changes
        - copy 'uploads' from prod
        - OPTIMIZE COMPOSER AUTOLOADER  (https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/performance.html)
            (Necessary to apply any changes to php classes)
            $ ssh user@batbase.org -p18765
            $ cd public_html/[dir]
            $ composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
            $ composer dump-autoload --no-dev --classmap-authoritative
            $ composer dump-env prod
            $ APP_ENV=prod APP_DEBUG=0 php bin/console cache:clear
        - test update happened successfully
        - clear cache
    - set up the main domain
        - push code to master
        - rerun webpack so sentry associates commits with release
        - replace asset build files
        - put clone into maintenance mode
        - update env for prod [db_name, release, role_qa]
        - rename current prod folder
        - replace all prod files with the clone's files
        - set up the new base database
        - remove maintenance mode from both prod and clone
        - reset clone's env variables.
        - delete the previous prod backup

## =========================== TESTING ====================================== ##

Start Selenium:
    $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar
    - Exit = ctrl+c
        - Clear port if necessary -  sudo fuser -k 4444/tcp

Run Tests:
    - Functional Tests (Behat/Mink):
        all tests: ./vendor/bin/behat
        single feature: ./vendor/bin/behat --tags @feature-file-tag
            ##Automatically ran at the start of tests:
            ##  (generate fixtures as needed: php bin/console generate:fixtures)
            ##  php bin/console doctrine:database:drop --force --env=test
            ##  php bin/console doctrine:database:create --env=test
            ##  php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force --env=test
            ##  php bin/console hautelook_alice:fixtures:load --no-interaction --env=test
    # - Unit Tests:
    #     $phpunit = ./vendor/bin/simple-phpunit
    #     [$phpunit] -c app/ tests
    #     [$phpunit] -c app/ tests/App/Controller/<Entity>ControllerTest.php

## ==================== Local Installation ================================== ##

>Install Steps ##
- Install & Update COMPOSER:
    - Composer https://getcomposer.org/download/
    - Extend php.ini memory-limit
    - php composer.phar update
        - Memory limit issues:
            - $ php -d memory_limit=-1 composer.phar install
                - $ php -d memory_limit=-1 ($ which composer = /usr/local/bin/composer)
- Set file permissions:
    - Mac (10.14)
        - https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/setup/file_permissions.html
        (If they haven't fixed the lack of recursion in the command, add it. Otherwise behat will not have the permissions it needs to run)
    - Linux (debian)
        $ sudo chgrp www-data /var/www/* -R //Make sure the group is www-data on '/var/www'
        $ sudo chmod 775 /var/www/* -R  //Make '/var/www' writable for the group
        $ sudo chmod g+s /var/www/* -R  //Set the GID for www-data for all sub-folders
        $ sudo usermod -a -G www-data [YOURUSERNAME]  // add your username to the www-data group
        Or/And (from symfony docs, didn't work before cmds above... probably user err)
        $ HTTPDUSER=$(ps axo user,comm | grep -E '[a]pache|[h]ttpd|[_]www|[w]ww-data|[n]ginx' | grep -v root | head -1 | cut -d\  -f1)
        $ sudo setfacl -dR -m u:"$HTTPDUSER":rwX -m u:[whoami?]:rwX var
        $ sudo setfacl -R -m u:"$HTTPDUSER":rwX -m u:[whoami?]:rwX var

##------------------- Bugs ---------------------------------------------------##
>::Known BUGS::
## Bugs that I attempted to solve but ended up stumped or without time to delve in more.
Search Page:
    - The grid filter menus seem to not get cleared and/or destroyed properly with
    each call to setRowData. If that menu was displayed with previous grid instances,
    the previous filter menu options will be displayed and the new ones on top of
    them, causing the text to appear boldened and difficult to read-- even worse
    the menu is obviously inaccurrate.
Forms:
    - Citation
        * Removing previously selected authors from the dropdowns of new authors will
        require a bit of creativity. Currently, only the last selected author name
        is removed from the new combobox's options.
        * Removing empty author comboboxes has proven more complicated than expected.
        There is a some weirdness on 'destroy' in the selectize library that needs
        to be isolated.
composer.json:
    -- Removed from symfony-scripts because it deletes everything in the web/bundles
      folder... The resoures/public is supposed to be symlinked into web/bundles folder
      on update, but it is not working. (waiting to fix, potentially after the 3.4 update)
      ("Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installAssets")
data wonkiness:
    - Id inconsistencies in the db are from early testing with the interaction
      form before Sarah was conscious of the need to 'remove' entities via doctrine,
      rather than just deleting test rows from the db. There is now a db-migration,
      000EraseTests, that removes test entities so they can be safely deleted from
      the db without remaining in memory.


>MISC
Errors:
    TAXON errors being caught:
        -- Can't change taxon to a level equal/beneath any children,
            -- or equal/above the parent.
        -- Species must have genus parent
        -- Can't change genus that has species children


>BEST PRACTICES
## Standards decided upon and why
alphabetize:
    Everything than can be should be.  (Adopted 2019-05-01)
comments:
    //right against the first letter to exclude uncommented instances of that word (consoles being the best -ever- to isolate)
    /*Perm-log*/, /*Debg-log*/
    - Tabs indicate depth in method chain.
    '+--' prepends comment logs that are the head of a method chain
