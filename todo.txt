            -- When nothing is selected but a country, a habitat type, and the 
                displayname, suggest to user they use the country-habitat combo
                that already exists.
        --Bugs-
            -- fix tabs on selectize (test whether firefox bug only??): 
                https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/commit/0c6fafc786d87cf30de6d1690565ec62ec0647c9
    --Asac---
        --form--
            -- Validate that genus and species have the same genus names.
            -- refactor initcomboboxes to need only the form-lvl param
            -- Refactor disableSubmitBttn away from passing in '#' and 'submit' 
                > or refactor into using it to general disable and dim buttons
                > or refactor both enable/disable submit methods into one func to rule them all
        --search--
            -- Add an 'All' option to taxon and location dropdowns to reset data 
                to that level and retain other filters- updated at for example.
            -- add selectize library
            -- standardize taxon 'levels' storage
            -- update all the comments that mention the updates-since filter to 
                'int-updated-at'
        --css--
            --refactor to use parital, effectively 'group', selectors
        --Bugs--
            - [low] new taxon form isn't returning the 'Creating [lvl]' option to select properly
    --Asap--        
        --form-- 
            -- Refactor 'form-hdr' into 'top-hdr'
            -- Data storage err - Ensure user can't close the form any other way 
                than clicking the 'ok' in the error meseage.
        -- data creation --
            -> If a new authors display name is identical to another's, prompt 
               user to check existing author for duplication, and then prompt 
               them to add initials if not.  
        --search--
            -- add note to the walkthrough to wait for load if the taxon-domain elem hasn't laoded yet.

Todo:
    > Edit forms: Close on update
        not on no changes
    > Fix responsiveness and formatting for the edit forms. 
    > Alpha init loc opts 
    > Future additions
        > Displaying contained data on data grid
    > Set min-widths for form windows
    > Fix bat data in csv export


::Testing!::
> Search Page
    > CSV downloads
    > Data Storage
        > Data is added and removed correctly  
        > The grid should reload as expect with the form close
            > With and without submit. 
            > interaction forms and sub-entity forms.
