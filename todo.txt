>Add map to Location FORMS
    - Add message to top form above the location fields to give map seleciton option
        - If clicked, open map for location selection
            -- Location selection --
                - Show map with ui that will filter and zoom the map by region/country
                - show all locations within the parent
                - Location selected by clicking on button in marker summary popup
        -- Creating a new Location --
            - Add message about map selection option
                - Allow search by name, address, (landmark?, ) and coordinates
            - If user enters coordinates into form
                - Show map and disable submit button
                - Search by coodinates and show all locations within the parent
            - Finish and select location
                - Show marker of different color at resulting point
                    - Click on map will move point
                - Show all locations within the parent
                - Select location by clickin button in marker summary popup

Before Release:
    - {high}[easy] When nothing is selected but a country, a habitat type, and the 
        displayname, suggest to user they use the country-habitat combo. 
    - {med}[med] Adjust form styles to shrink label width and increase field rows
        to fill form better. (match width of map in location form)
    - {low}{med} Add search by name to the location table view
    - Handle multiple habitats of parent country displaying at same point - combine
    - Cluster counts of all locs within country markers when showing locations in a region


    - add button to "select existing location"
        - close form and select location 

    
MEETING NOTES:
    Next/future round:
        - Draw areas and select as parent location
        - add "outline" option
        - Is location name being optional still a priority?
        - add "click to create point" button? (only if fields blank)
            - add button to "drag" pin
                - ultimately help adjust display point for country

TODOs:
(CRUD FORMS/BACKEND)
    - {high}[med] add error to interaction form for when an 'invisible' error 
        occurs on entity selection (figure out how to trigger, then do this)
    - {med}[med] Switch from localStorage to idb everywhere.
    - {med}[med] add err in CRUD controllers eliminating the possibility of 
        creating orphans (Maybe not needed with the JS side handling this.)

(DATA)

(SEARCH PAGE)
    - {---}[---] Upgrade to the latest AgGrid. Super out of date at this point.

    - {med}[med, long] Add data-entry tutorial.
    - {low}[med] Add an 'All' option to taxon and location dropdowns to reset data 
        to that level and retain other filters - (updated at for example).
    - {med}[???] Figure out what the "scroll-linked positioning effect." is on the page
    - {med}[easy] Change taxon row coloring when showing updated records

(STATIC/MISC SITE)

    - {med}[med] Refactor fixtures so that entity changes are easier to handle
    - {high}{med} Ensure UI updates as it should when toggling to map
        - search options dimmed and unavailable

(PWA)
    - {low}[easy] Configure webpack's manifest plugin
    - {med}[med] Set up html-webpack-plugin to cache html assets https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin

(REFACTORING):
    --CRUD--
        - {med}[crud.js] Add '-sel' to the edit taxon form's 'txn-lvl' field 
        - {low}[easy] Refactor disableSubmitBttn away from passing in '#' and 'submit' 
            - or into using it to general disable and dim buttons
            - or both enable/disable submit methods into one func to rule them all
        - {low}[med] Move interaction create form functions into the same func chain building the rest? 
        - {low}[easy] Change to sisngular tense in ref panel where appropriate. (taxon view complete)

        - {low}[med] Download records once and store in memory. (miscObj, maybe?)
    --Testing--
        - {low}[easy] Refactor tests away from sleeping after js changes to attempting to run 
            js or find elems on page multiple times before failing, 'spinning'.

(BUGS):
    --CRUD FORMS--
        - {low}[med] fix tabs on selectize (test whether firefox bug only??)
            - https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/commit/0c6fafc786d87cf30de6d1690565ec62ec0647c9
