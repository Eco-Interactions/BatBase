>Add map to Location FORMS
    - Add message to top form above the location fields to give map seleciton option
        - If clicked, open map for location selection
            -- Location selection --
                - Show map with ui that will filter and zoom the map by region/country
                - show all locations within the parent
                - Location selected by clicking on button in marker summary popup
        -- Creating a new Location --
            - Add message about map selection option
                - Allow search by name, address, (landmark?, ) and coordinates
            - If user enters coordinates into form
                - Show map and disable submit button
                - Search by coodinates and show all locations within the parent
            - Finish and select location
                - Show marker of different color at resulting point
                    - Click on map will move point
                - Show all locations within the parent
                - Select location by clickin button in marker summary popup

Before Release:
    - Handle multiple habitats of parent country displaying at same point - combine
    - Ensure that the country selected contains the point entered
    - add lat, long popup for clicks on map.
    - add error handling for when a loc with no geojson data is selected
        eg, "Unspecified" region our of the country/region combobox
    - add loading message to map when updating 


Notes from geocoders:
    - Photon, mapbox, here: 
        poor search results
    - Bing (125K yearly, ~10.5K searches montlhy):
        good search results
    - Google (40k searches montlhy):
        against terms of service to use with leaflet
    - Mapquest (15K monthly):
        poor search results 


    Testing:
        - Enter map from top form and create form
        - Country locations show on map
        - New map pin drops
        - Select existing location and form closes

    
MEETING NOTES:
    Point out:
        - Entering coordinates first fills country and suggests a display name in the popup
        - Updated countries ith 2-letter iso codes, which revealed a couple 
            duplicate countries. Cleaned up this data.
        - Errs that catch invalid coordinates
            - Ensure all required fields are filled in
    Next/future round:
        Next:
            - Add button to map that will allow click-to-create on the map (kind of like the drag button)
            - Err handling
                - ensure that entered coordinates are within selected country
                    on country change
                    on form submit
            - {high}[easy] When nothing is selected but a country, a habitat type, 
                and the displayname, suggest to user they use the country-habitat combo. 

        Future:
        - {low}{med} Add search by name to the location table view
        - Get geojson shape data for all remaining top country/regions. 
            Lmk if there is one that is needed sooner
        - Draw areas and select as parent location
        - add "outline" option
        - Is location name being optional still a priority?
        - add "click to create point" button? (only if fields blank)
            - add button to "drag" pin
                - ultimately help adjust display point for country

        - Improve search results
