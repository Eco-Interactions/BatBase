Thoughts:
    - Leave redundant or unnecessary code commented out until tests are ran to help 
        trouble shoot when issues arrise.

    Feedback:



>================ DEV Internal Task List ===================

>taxon form BUGS
    - When new taxon is created, the previous display name check isn't prompting the editor to change the name
        Add more complicated check to make sure no other taxonym in the realm has the same name
    - 103 duplicates
    Solution ideas:
        - Add text search to taxa views to help eliminate creating duplicates
        - Reverse order of taxon level inputs in select form to encourage searching for the most specific taxon first

Sort:
    - ensure that entered coordinates are within selected country
        on country change, on form submit
    - Create review data interface after
    - Add spanish translations to site
    - Refactor getTableState to take one arg and determine if it's singular or an array
    - Upgrade to encore 0.21 & webpack 4
    - Break util into 
        - data storage
        - combobox/selectize?
        - extend
        - html
    - Refactor form code
        - break out css
    - refactor out all styles for the panel displays
    - Figure out whether the explicit form services are necessary
    - Refactor TESTS
        - replace all usleeps with "spinner" wait methods
        - Registration emails are sent https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/email/testing.html
    - Accessibility REFACTORING 
        - text to speech, etc
    - refactor @initCOmbobox to take change methods when it makes more sense to pass rather than include 
##(Category){priority}[difficulty]##
TODOs:
(CRUD FORMS/BACKEND)
    - {high}[easy] When nothing is selected but a country, a habitat type, 
        and the displayname, suggest to user they use the country-habitat combo.

        occurs on entity selection (figure out how to trigger, then do this)
    - {med}[med] Switch from localStorage to idb everywhere.
    - {med}[med] add err in CRUD controllers eliminating the possibility of 
        creating orphans (Maybe not needed with the JS side handling this.)

(DATA)

        - {low}[easy] Refactor disableSubmitBttn away from passing in '#' and 'submit'

            - or both enable/disable submit methods into one func to rule them all
        - {low}[med] Move interaction create form functions into the same func chain building the rest?

    --Testing--
        - {low}[easy] Refactor tests away from sleeping after js changes to attempting to run 
            js or find elems on page multiple times before failing, 'spinning'.

(BUGS):
    --CRUD FORMS--
        - {low}[med] fix tabs on selectize (test whether firefox bug only??)
            - https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/commit/0c6fafc786d87cf30de6d1690565ec62ec0647c9
