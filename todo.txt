        Next:
            - UI:
                - Create saved lists of interactions 
            - Err handling:
                - ensure that entered coordinates are within selected country
                    on country change, on form submit
                - {high}[easy] When nothing is selected but a country, a habitat type, 
                and the displayname, suggest to user they use the country-habitat combo. 
            - testing:

        Future:
            - Data:
                - Add more realms
            - Edit form:
                - allow selection of another location and merging of all data and 
                    deletion of location being edited
            - Features: 
                - Draw areas and select as parent location
                - Get shape data for mising countries and regions
                    - Eg, Central America. Priority?

##(Category){priority}[difficulty]##
TODOs:
(CRUD FORMS/BACKEND)
    - {high}[med] add error to interaction form for when an 'invisible' error 
        occurs on entity selection (figure out how to trigger, then do this)
    - {med}[med] Switch from localStorage to idb everywhere.
    - {med}[med] add err in CRUD controllers eliminating the possibility of 
        creating orphans (Maybe not needed with the JS side handling this.)

(DATA)

(SEARCH PAGE)
    - {---}[---] Upgrade to the latest AgGrid. Super out of date at this point.
        - Unable to update as rowGrouping is now an enterprise feature (ie min $800 package)
    - {med}[med] Replace Data Tables with AgGrid on the feedback and biblio pages
    - {med}[med, long] Add data-entry tutorial.
    - {low}[med] Add an 'All' option to taxon and location dropdowns to reset data 
        to that level and retain other filters - (updated at for example).
    - {med}[???] Figure out what the "scroll-linked positioning effect." is on the page
    - {med}[easy] Change taxon row coloring when showing updated records

(STATIC/MISC SITE)
    - {med}[complicated] Implement Encore for assets
    - {med}[complicated] Switch from pixels to percent with styles to better adapt to smaller screen resolutions
    - {lox}[med] Graph active users over time. 
        - daily max users?
    - {med}[easy] Add headers and css styles to FOS pages 
        - change password page (/profile/change-password)
        - update profile page (/profile/edit)
        - Reorder fields for profile edit form
    - {low}[med] Update read me for site.
    - {low}[easy] Resize slider-header when screen size changes 

(SYNC-DATA)
    - {high}[med] Add error handling for pending updates that can't be resolved 

(TESTS)
    - {med}[med] Refactor fixtures so that entity changes are easier to handle
    - {high}{med} Ensure UI updates as it should when toggling to map
        - search options dimmed and unavailable

(PWA)
    - {low}[easy] Configure webpack's manifest plugin
    - {med}[med] Set up html-webpack-plugin to cache html assets https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin

(REFACTORING):
    --CRUD--
        - {med}[crud.js] Add '-sel' to the edit taxon form's 'txn-lvl' field 
        - {low}[easy] Refactor disableSubmitBttn away from passing in '#' and 'submit' 
            - or into using it to general disable and dim buttons
            - or both enable/disable submit methods into one func to rule them all
        - {low}[med] Move interaction create form functions into the same func chain building the rest? 
        - {low}[easy] Change to sisngular tense in ref panel where appropriate. (taxon view complete)
    --General--
        - {med}[easy] use parital, effectively 'group', css selectors
    --Search Page--
        - {med}{easy} update Loc and Taxa views to alternate color rows as Src is now. 
        - {low}[med] fillHiddenTaxaColumns... The comments and code are confusing
        - {low}[med] Download records once and store in memory. (miscObj, maybe?)
    --Testing--
        - {low}[easy] Refactor tests away from sleeping after js changes to attempting to run 
            js or find elems on page multiple times before failing, 'spinning'.

(BUGS):
    --CRUD FORMS--
        - {low}[med] fix tabs on selectize (test whether firefox bug only??)
            - https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/commit/0c6fafc786d87cf30de6d1690565ec62ec0647c9
        - {low}[easy] Fix author field after create form exited
        - {med}[easy] Fix 'no changes detected' when only author/editor data is changed
