        - {low}[easy] Refactor disableSubmitBttn away from passing in '#' and 'submit' 
            - or into using it to general disable and dim buttons
            - or both enable/disable submit methods into one func to rule them all
        - {low}[med] Move interaction create form functions into the same func chain building the rest?
