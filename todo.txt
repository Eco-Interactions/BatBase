    - implement
        -- Find way to show how many interactions have no location to display?
        -- Create 'custom' icon for single markers
        -- add editing to countries/regions for supers/admins with modified forms so gps data can be added.

    - TODO:

    - AFTER: 
        -- Update db page tutorial

        - 
    - Next Round:
        - Programmatically load sets of data accoding to zoom size and map viewport
            - Allow for clustering at higher levels with helpful popups
Data Changes:
    
BUG:
    - loc summary popups for markers aren't reverting to originals when 2 are opened
        and closed at the time.


Before Release:
    -- update tests with the new selectized elem apis

    
MEETING NOTES:
    - Country/region-habitat locations still need to be configured to display on the map
    - Locations with the exact same gps coordinates will be right on top of eachother 
        in the map view. This can be fixed with some intelligence that will tell if another 
        pin exists at that location already and can add them to a cluster.
    Next/future round:
        - Programmatically load sets of data accoding to zoom size and map viewport
            - Allow for clustering at higher levels with helpful popups
        -- Update db page tutorial
        -- Create 'custom' icon for single markers
        -- add editing to countries/regions for supers/admins with modified forms so gps data can be added.
    Feedback:
        - Changed location tree column to fit additional loc data
        - Changed 'Interaction Type' to 'Type' in order to give space for additional data. Thoughts?
        - Would ya like to be able to move the loc summary popups around?
