>Add map to Location FORMS
    - Editing Location - 
        - insert map
        - show location pin on map
        - show green pin when coordinates change
        - add button to switch to location merge mode
            - eventually add this functionality


Notes from geocoders:
    - Photon, mapbox, here: 
        poor search results
    - Bing (125K yearly, ~10.5K searches montlhy):
        good(ish) search results, uses HERE backend
    - Google (40k searches montlhy):
        against terms of service to use with leaflet
    - Mapquest (15K monthly):
        poor search results 

    Testing:
        - Enter map from top form and create form
        - Country locations show on map
        - New map pin drops
        - Select existing location and form closes

Before Release:

MEETING NOTES:
    Point out:
    Next/future rounds:
        Next:
            - Buttons:
                - click-to-create pin on the map (kind of like the drag button)
                - Drag 
            - Edit form: - update geojson location name
            - Err handling:
                - ensure that entered coordinates are within selected country
                    on country change, on form submit
                - {high}[easy] When nothing is selected but a country, a habitat type, 
                and the displayname, suggest to user they use the country-habitat combo. 
            - testing:

        Future:
            - Edit form:
                - allow selection of another location and merging of all data and 
                    deletion of location being edited
            - Features: 
                - Draw areas and select as parent location
                - Get shape data for mising countries and regions
                    - Eg, Central America. Priority?
                - Optional Location name. Priority?
                - Adjust display point for country
                - {low}{med} Add search by name to the location table view
                - Improve search results
                - Future Tool Tips for fields that require more explanations

TODOs:

    - {high}[med] add error to interaction form for when an 'invisible' error 
        occurs on entity selection (figure out how to trigger, then do this)
    - {med}[med] Switch from localStorage to idb everywhere.
    - {med}[med] add err in CRUD controllers eliminating the possibility of 
        creating orphans (Maybe not needed with the JS side handling this.)

(DATA)

(SEARCH PAGE)

    - {med}[med, long] Add data-entry tutorial.

    - {med}[easy] Change taxon row coloring when showing updated records

        - {med}[crud.js] Add '-sel' to the edit taxon form's 'txn-lvl' field 
        - {low}[easy] Refactor disableSubmitBttn away from passing in '#' and 'submit' 
            - or into using it to general disable and dim buttons
            - or both enable/disable submit methods into one func to rule them all
        - {low}[med] Move interaction create form functions into the same func chain building the rest?

    --Testing--
        - {low}[easy] Refactor tests away from sleeping after js changes to attempting to run 
            js or find elems on page multiple times before failing, 'spinning'.

    --CRUD FORMS--

            - https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/commit/0c6fafc786d87cf30de6d1690565ec62ec0647c9
