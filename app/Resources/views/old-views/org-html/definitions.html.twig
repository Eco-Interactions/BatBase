		<h3>Definitions of Interaction Types</h3>
		<p>This database only contains accounts of bats interacting with plants or arthropods and not hypotheses that they might (e.g. a flower has chiropterophilous features). We report what is published and do not assume that every visit to a flower results in pollination or that every fruit eaten results in seed dispersal. We do assume that every object that is consumed is destroyed in the process.
		<ul>
		<li><span class="lbl">Flower Pollination</span>– the animal visits the flower and in so doing comes into contact with the reproductive parts (anthers and stigma), and deposited pollen on the stigma, resulting in fertilization and development of fruit/seeds. The action is confirmed if fruits develop.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Flower Visitation</span>– the animal visits flowers to collect nectar or pollen, but it is not confirmed that it has come into contact with the flower’s reproductive parts. Pollen may be found on fur, in feces or stomach.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Flower Consumption</span>– the animal deliberately eats flowers to the extent that the damage is greater than the potential benefits of pollen transport and pollination is thus unlikely.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Seed dispersal</span>– the animal removes fruit/seed (diaspore) from the parent plant and deposits seeds in a new location without harming them. This can include the following types of primary dispersal:
			<ul class="disc-list">
				<li class="cav">endozoochorous (diaspore is ingested and passed unharmed through the digestive tract of an animal),</li>
				<li class="cav">epizoochorous (diaspore sticks to the skin, feathers, or fur of an animal by barbs, hooks, or viscid surface), or</li>
				<li class="cav">stomatochorous (diaspore is deliberately carried away by an animal and dropped with viable seeds after the edible parts are consumed)<br>
					Note: the database does not determine how far bats are moving seeds, if the seeds are mature when dispersed, if seeds are dropped at location suitable for germination.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Seed consumption</span>– the animal may appear to be dispersing seeds/fruit, but in actuality is deliberately masticating or otherwise destroying seeds when feeding (example: Chiroderma feeding on Ficus in Nogueira & Peracchi, 2003).</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Fruit consumption</span>– the animal feeds on fruit en situ on the parent plant or cache without moving seeds or fruit away from the location at which they were found.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Leaf consumption</span>– the animal deliberately chews or eats leaves.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Arthropod consumption</span>– the animal deliberately consumes arthropods in the air, on a surface, or in the water.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Arthropod transport</span>– the animal is being used by the arthropod as a transport agent (e.g, flower mites moving from one plant to another) or as a moving food source (e.g., an ectoparasite living on the outside of a bat).</li>

		<h3>Definitions of Habitat Types</h3>
		<p>The terrestrial habitat types used by this database are listed below and are the standard terms used in the IUCN Red List Habitats Authority File (Version 3.0). It is acknowledged that the classification scheme used here may not be entirely satisfactory but it provides a standardization of habitat types for analytical purposes.</p>
		<p>This database only report data as it is published and does not make changes or evaluates accuracy of the species accounts. </p>
		<ol class="def-ol">
		<li><span class="lbl">Forest:</span>  Forest consists of a continuous stand of trees and includes both forested areas (generally with a closed canopy) and wooded areas (canopy more open but see savanna below). Primary and secondary forest habitats and forest edge are all included.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Savanna:</span>  Savannas are ecosystems dominated by a grass ground cover with an overstory of widely spaced trees. May be referred to as savanna woodlands, savanna parklands, savanna grasslands, low tree/shrub savannas, thicket/scrub savannas. Distributed largely in Africa, Australia (mostly northern), Asia (India, SE Asia) and South America.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Shrubland:</span>  Also referred to as scrub, bushland and thicket.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Grassland:</span>  It consists of land covered with grasses and other herbs, either without woody plants, or the latter very sparsely distributed (see savanna). Grasslands occur in regions with warm growing seasons and moderate water shortages. Native grasslands are comprised of grasses and broadleaved herbaceous plants, and are either without woody plants, or the latter are very sparsely distributed.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Wetlands (Inland):</span>  Wetlands correspond to the wetland types recognised by Ramsar. NB. Includes only inland waters – other types are not covered by this database. </li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Rocky Areas:</span>  Includes inland cliffs, mountain peaks, talus, feldmark.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Caves and Subterranean Habitats (Non-aquatic):</span>  Underground spaces produced naturally by the weathering of rock. Can extend deep underground, or can be much smaller rock. </li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Desert:</span>  Desert consists of arid landscapes with a sparse plant cover, except in depressions where water accumulates. The sandy, stony or rocky substrate contributes more to the appearance of the landscape than does the vegetation.</li>
		<li><span class="lbl">Artificial landscapes:</span>  It consists of human-made landscapes, such as agricultural land, suburban and urban areas. </li>
