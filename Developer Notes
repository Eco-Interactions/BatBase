## DEPLOYMENT / INSTALLATION ##

Deployment Steps:
    >Cache busting:
        config.yml:
            "Framework":
                assets:
                    version: 'v%'"              

Install Cmds
  > composer update
  > Set file permissions:
    > Ubuntu : 
      $ sudo chgrp www-data /var/www/* -R //Make sure the group is www-data on '/var/www'
      $ sudo chmod 775 /var/www/* -R  //Make '/var/www' writable for the group
      $ sudo chmod g+s /var/www/* -R  //Set the GID for www-data for all sub-folders
      $ sudo usermod -a -G www-data [YOURUSERNAME]  // add your username to the www-data group
      Or/And (from symfony docs, didn't work before cmds above... probably user err)
       $ HTTPDUSER=$(ps axo user,comm | grep -E '[a]pache|[h]ttpd|[_]www|[w]ww-data|[n]ginx' | grep -v root | head -1 | cut -d\  -f1)
       $ sudo setfacl -dR -m u:"$HTTPDUSER":rwX -m u:[whoami?]:rwX var
       $ sudo setfacl -R -m u:"$HTTPDUSER":rwX -m u:[whoami?]:rwX var
    > Extend php.ini memory-limit


## TESTING ##
HOW TO RUN TESTS
    phpunit -c app/ tests   
    phpunit -c app/ tests/AppBundle/Controller/<Entity>ControllerTest.php       


## BEST PRACTICES ##
    comments:
        //right against the first letter to exclude uncommented instances of that word (consoles being the best -ever- to isolate)

::BUGS::
    ## Search Page ##
    >> The grid filter menus seem to not get cleared and/or destroyed properly with 
      each call to setRowData. If that menu was displayed with previous grid instances, 
      the previous filter menu options will be displayed and the new ones on top of 
      them, causing the text to appear boldened and difficult to read-- even worse 
      the menu is obviously inaccurrate. 
    ## Forms ##
        >> Citation
          --Removing previously selected authors from the dropdowns of new authors will 
            require a bit of creativity. Currently, only the last selected author name 
            is removed from the new combobox's options.  
          --Removing empty author comboboxes has proven more complicated than expected. 
            There is a some weirdness on 'destroy' in the selectize library that needs 
            to be isolated.

    ## composer.json ## 
    -- Removed from symfony-scripts because it deletes everything in the web/bundles 
      folder... The resoures/public is supposed to be symlinked into web/bundles folder 
      on update, but it is not working. (waiting to fix, potentially after the 3.4 update):
      "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installAssets",  





::Checked data wonkiness::
    -'northern mariana islands' is the name from red list.
    - Id inconsistencies in the db are from early testing with the interaction 
      form before Sarah was conscious of the need to 'remove' entities via doctrine, 
      rather than just deleting test rows from the db. There is now a db-migration, 
      000EraseTests, that removes test entities so they can be safely deleted from 
      the db without remaining in memory.
