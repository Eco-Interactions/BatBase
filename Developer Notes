Developer Notes:



::BUGS::
    ## Search Page ##
    >> The grid filter menus seem to not get cleared and/or destroyed properly with 
      each call to setRowData. If that menu was displayed with previous grid instances, 
      the previous filter menu options will be displayed and the new ones on top of 
      them, causing the text to appear boldened and difficult to read-- even worse 
      the menu is obviously inaccurrate. 





::Checked data wonkiness::
    -'northern mariana islands' is the name from red list.
    - Id inconsistencies in the Citation, Publication, and Source table are from 
      early testing with the interaction form before Sarah was conscious of the 
      need to 'remove' entities via doctrine, rather than just deleting test rows 
      from the db. There is now a db-migration, 000EraseTests, that removes test 
      entities so they can be safely deleted from the db without remaining in memory.


::data cleanup::
    -Location 
        -weird '- duplicate entry'
