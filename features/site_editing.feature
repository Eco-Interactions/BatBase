Feature: Wysiwyg site text editing
	In order to edit the text on the main pages
	As an admin or editor
	I should be able to use the wysiwyg editor to modify the text

    #Needs to be updated
    
	# Background:
	# 	Given I am on "/login"
	# 	And I fill in "Username" with "TestAdmin"
	# 	And I fill in "Password" with "passwordhere"
	# 	And I press "_submit"
	# 	Then I should see "TestAdmin"

	# @javascript  # changes to inner text not registered by wysiwyg editor 
	# Scenario:  I should be edit the content blocks on the static pages
	# 	Given I am on "/"
	# 	And I press "Edit Content"
	# 	When I press the edit pencil for the "home page second column"
	# 	And I change the header to "New Bat-Eco Interactions Title"
	# 	And I break
	# 	And I save and close the wysiwyg editor
	# 	And I break
	# 	Then I should see "New Bat-Eco Interactions Title"
